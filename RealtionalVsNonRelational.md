**Relational Database**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Data is secured and enables more complex query to access data.
- Any transaction must adhere to ACID properties.
- A table based data structure with strict predfined schema.
- Vertically scalable, but expensive (because single server is needed to host entire database, to scale we need to buy a bigger expensicve server)
Disadvantage : SQL is less equipped with growing data volumes and complex data structures

**Non-Relational Database**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Data can be in Document-based or graph-based or key-value based data structures.
- No strict schema required and hence helps handling "unstructured data"
- horizontally scalable and cost effective.(horizantally scaled by adding more capacity by cheap servers)2. Using cloud computing and storage

Relational DB vs Non-Relational DB:
Votes for RDB:
1. You need ACID compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Your data is structured and unchanging
Votes for NRDB:
1. Storing large volumes of data without structure
2. Using cloud computing and storage
3. Rapid development. (Agile methodology)
